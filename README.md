A site built in [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) that uses the [nationalize.io](https://nationalize.io/), [genderize.io](https://genderize.io/) and the [agify.io](https://agify.io/) apis to guess your age, nationality and age from your name



### Self hosting:
To self host and for developmentyou need python 3.11 or above[^1] 
in terminal, navigate to the `guessyou` folder and run 

`python -m pip install -r /requirements.txt`

[^1]:version 3.11 or above is fine, older versions may work but I haven't tested them
